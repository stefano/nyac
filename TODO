- equal hash table
- add support for continuations
- stack trace should limit output length, in particular when printing 
  sequences
- capture signal SIGKILL and then show backtrace before exiting
- make basic forms check for number of arguments *done

  C's stack will overflow *solved
- test the garbage collector
- mkvec and mkstr don't initialize their elements *solved

- add more floating point operations
- add generic operations that work with both fixnums and floats
