IMPORTANT:

When compiling the compiler with itself (using bootstrap.arc.run), 
the macros compiled will not be loaded in the the host runtime, so the 
compiled code will be macroexpanded using _only_ the macros available in 
the host compiler.
This avoids a lot of problems when compiling a new version of the compiler 
that targets a runtime different from that of the host compiler.
For the same reason, the compiler code shouldn't use 'eval

How to use a macro in the compiler code?

- Write the macro
- Recompile the compiler
- Now the macro can be used in the compiler sources when they are compiled
  with the new version of the compiler
